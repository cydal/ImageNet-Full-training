### Warnings (Non-Critical)
1. **Pin memory warning**: Expected when no GPU is used during test
   ```
   'pin_memory' argument is set as true but no accelerator is found
   ```
   - **Impact**: None (test runs on CPU)
   - **Action**: No action needed, will work correctly with GPU

2. **Trainer reference warning**: Expected when testing module standalone
   ```
   self.trainer reference is not registered on the model yet
   ```
   - **Impact**: None (expected behavior)
   - **Action**: No action needed, will work correctly in full training

### Verified Components
- ✅ Data loading from `/data2/imagenet`
- ✅ Dataset sizes correct (1.28M train, 50K val)
- ✅ Model creation (ResNet50 with 25.5M params)
- ✅ Forward pass with correct shapes
- ✅ Loss computation
- ✅ Backward pass
- ✅ Gradient computation

### Environment
- Python: 3.11
- Lightning: 2.x.x (using `lightning.pytorch`)
- PyTorch: 2.x.x
- Data path: `/data2/imagenet`

### Next Steps
1. Run full data module tests: `make test-data`
2. Run data integrity tests: `make test-integrity`
3. Run benchmarks: `make benchmark-data`
4. Single epoch training test

## Data Module Tests - Pending

### Status: ⏳ NOT YET RUN

### Command
```bash
make test-data
```

### Expected Results
- Dataset statistics
- Batch loading verification
- Preprocessing validation
- Throughput measurement (target: >500 images/sec)

---

## Data Integrity Tests - Pending

### Status: ⏳ NOT YET RUN

### Command
```bash
make test-integrity
```

### Expected Results
- 1000 classes in train/val
- No corrupted images (or <0.1%)
- Validation: 50 images per class
- Report generated: `data_integrity_report.txt`

---

## Benchmark Tests - Pending

### Status: ⏳ NOT YET RUN

### Command
```bash
make benchmark-data
```

### Expected Results
- Optimal `num_workers` identified
- Throughput for different configurations
- Performance recommendations

---

## Training Tests - Pending

### Status: ⏳ NOT YET RUN

### Single Epoch Test
```bash
python train.py --config configs/local.yaml --epochs 1 --no_wandb
```

### Expected Results
- Training completes without errors
- Checkpoint saved
- Validation accuracy > 0% (random baseline ~0.1%)
- GPU utilization monitored
