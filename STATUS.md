## Recent Changes (Oct 14, 2025)

### 1. Import Updates ✅
- Changed all imports from `pytorch_lightning` to `lightning.pytorch`
- Updated 6 Python files
- Updated `requirements.txt`

### 2. Test Status Clarification ✅
- Added clear warnings that tests are NOT YET EXECUTED
- Separated "code implemented" from "test executed"
- Added Phase 0: Environment Setup to test plan

### 3. Documentation Improvements ✅
- Created `SETUP.md` with installation instructions
- Updated `README.md` with setup requirements
- Created `CHANGELOG.md` documenting changes
- Updated test plan with execution status

## Next Steps (In Order)

### ✅ Step 1: Install Dependencies - COMPLETED
```bash
cd /home/ubuntu/imagenet
make install
```

**Status**: ✅ Dependencies installed and verified

### ✅ Step 2: Quick Test - COMPLETED
```bash
make quick-test
```

**Status**: ✅ All tests passed (Oct 14, 2025)

### Step 3: Data Module Tests (5-10 minutes)
```bash
make test-data
```

**Expected**: 
- Train: ~1.28M images
- Val: 50K images
- Throughput: 500-2000 images/sec

### Step 4: Data Integrity (2-5 minutes)
```bash
make test-integrity
```

**Expected**:
- 1000 classes in train/val
- No corrupted images (or < 0.1%)
- Report generated

### Step 5: Benchmark (10-15 minutes)
```bash
make benchmark-data
```

**Expected**:
- Optimal num_workers identified
- Performance recommendations

### Step 6: Single Epoch Training (30-60 minutes)
```bash
python train.py --config configs/local.yaml --epochs 1 --no_wandb
```

**Expected**:
- Training completes
- Checkpoint saved
- Validation accuracy > 0%

## Files Changed

### Python Files (6)
- `data/datamodule.py` - Import updated
- `models/resnet50.py` - Import updated
- `utils/callbacks.py` - Import updated
- `train.py` - Import updated
- `eval.py` - Import updated
- `tests/quick_test.py` - Import updated

### Configuration Files (1)
- `requirements.txt` - Package name corrected

### Documentation Files (5)
- `README.md` - Added setup warning
- `SETUP.md` - New file with installation guide
- `CHANGELOG.md` - New file documenting changes
- `STATUS.md` - This file
- `tests/test_plan_datamodule.md` - Clarified test status

## Key Points

### ✅ What's Ready
- All code is written and organized
- Test scripts are implemented
- Documentation is complete
- Configuration files are set up

### ⏳ What's Needed
- Install dependencies (`make install`)
- Run tests to verify everything works
- Optimize dataloader settings
- Execute training

### ❌ What's NOT Done
- Environment setup
- Test execution
- Performance benchmarking
- Training runs

## Import Changes Summary

### Before (Old)
```python
import pytorch_lightning as pl
from pytorch_lightning.callbacks import Callback
from pytorch_lightning.loggers import WandbLogger
```

### After (New)
```python
import lightning.pytorch as pl
from lightning.pytorch.callbacks import Callback
from lightning.pytorch.loggers import WandbLogger
```

**Reason**: Lightning 2.0+ uses new package structure
