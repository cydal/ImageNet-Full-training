## Next Steps

You can now proceed with training:

### Option 1: Single Epoch Test (Recommended First)
```bash
python train.py --config configs/local.yaml --epochs 1 --no_wandb
```
**Purpose:** Verify full training pipeline (30-60 minutes)

### Option 2: Benchmark Performance (Optional)
```bash
make benchmark-data
```
**Purpose:** Optimize num_workers and batch_size (10-15 minutes)

### Option 3: Full Local Training
```bash
make train-local
```
**Purpose:** Train for 10 epochs with local config (3-5 hours)

---

## Performance Notes

### Current Throughput: 445 images/sec
- Running on CPU (no GPU detected during tests)
- Expected to improve significantly with GPU
- Target with GPU: 800-2000 images/sec

### Recommendations:
1. **With GPU**: Throughput should increase 2-5x
2. **Optimize num_workers**: Run benchmark to find optimal value
3. **Monitor GPU utilization**: Ensure data loading isn't a bottleneck
